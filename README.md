# Connection_pool
Assigment 4 connection pooling using jdbc
4. Design a class for a simple database connection pool. The class should have the following features:
    - A private constructor to prevent the class from being instantiated directly.
    - A static method that returns an instance of the class (following the singleton pattern).
    - A method that returns a new connection to the database.
    - A method that closes all open connections and releases them back to the pool.
